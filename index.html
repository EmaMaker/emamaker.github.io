<p>Hello, I&#8217;m Emanuele, and this is my website!</p>

<p>I like coding, electronics and robotics :)</p>

<p>I started messing around with LEGO Mindstorm when I was around 10, then I started using Arduino while in middle school.
While in high school, I studied industrial automation <a href="./projects/spqr.html">and had a chance to pursue my passion for robotics</a>. I&#8217;m currently studying to get a bachelor degree in automation engineering.
In this little corner of the web I will write about my projects, ideas and notes on the stuff I think could be useful to others, or that I just feel like sharing.</p>

<p>I have never really fancied the use of social networks, I only ever had an <a href="https://instagram.com/emamaker">Instagram account</a> which is now quite abandoned. I currently only browse Reddit and YouTube to keep up with the stuff I like, via FOSS apps like Infinity and NewPipe.</p>

<p>I really like the style of HTML-and-CSS static websites, hence the simple style of this one. This website is statically generated from markdown using <a href="https://git.alemauri.eu/alema/rivet">rivet</a>, a static website generator written in POSIX compliant sh <a href="https://alemauri.eu"> by my dear friend Alessandro Mauri. Check him out!</a></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
