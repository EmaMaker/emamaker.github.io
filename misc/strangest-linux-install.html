<p>My dad bought an HP EliteBook 820 G2 for cheap. It came without an hard drive, but looking at
the mobo, it supported both 2.5&#8217; sata and a M.2 slot. However, the M.2 slot only supported 40mm and 60mm drives.</p>

<p>Moreover, the 2.5&#8217; slot needs an adapter from the pins exposed on the mobo to a proper sata
connector, which our laptop is lacking. This meant that I could not use some SSDs I had laying around.</p>

<p>Anyway, we managed to find 40mm M.2 drives on eBay and we bought one, has the shipping
 required less time that ordering the adapter (at nearly the same cost).</p>

<p>My dad has some hardware (namely a ScanSnap scanner) that only works on Windows (not supported
     by SANE yet :&#47;), so once I installed the drive I went
 to install Windows, but I got an error saying &#8220;Windows could not be installed on
 this drive&#8221;, pointing to some BIOS options preventing the drive from being used as a bootable
 device.</p>

<p>So I went and checked the boot options in the BIOS, and made sure the M.2&#47;NVME option was
 enabled and first in priority. The I tried installing windows again, only to be greeted with
 the same error.</p>

<p>Mh, strange. Let&#8217;s try with Linux, what could go wrong? I plug in my Ventoy USB stick and boot
Linux Mint. Install process is flawless and finished without errors, so I reboot, eject the
install media to boot into the newly installed OS. Now the laptop is behaving like there is
no OS installed. </p>

<p>Ok, let&#8217;s check the boot menu. No EFI partitions found to boot OSes from.</p>

<p>Maybe a bad drive? Bad installation? I boot up the Mint installer again and check the partitions.
Everything is there, no problem. I also tried using the 80mm M.2 NVME drive from my main laptop, again to no avail.</p>

<p>So, apparently the BIOS lists the M.2 NVME drive as a bootable medium, but cannot actually boot
stuff from it. Like, WHAT, WHY? I honestly cannot explain how much this confuses me. <a href="!https://alemauri.eu">A friend of
mine</a> advanced the hypothesis that the slot also works for M.2 mSata drives, and the BIOS has
drivers for those but lacks drivers for NVME. Makes sense, although I don&#8217;t have a mSata
drive laying around to test.</p>

<p>BUT, low and behold, the BIOS also lists the SD card as a bootable medium. And in the boot menu I can actually look
for efi files in the SD card.</p>

<p>My next trick takes a page out of old school Raspberry Pi.
Before the newer generations of Pi (namely before the Pi4) came around, Raspberry Pi&#8217;s didn&#8217;t natevely support booting from USB, and only
supported booting from the SD card, yet people used USB SDD&#8217;s as OS drives, only having the SD
Card to launch the bootloader, which then loaded the OS from the USB SDD.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s exactly what we do: we install a working bootloader for Linux on the sdcard, point
it to load the OS from the NVME SSD, then I edit <code>&#47;etc&#47;fstab</code> to mount the SD Card as the
<code>&#47;boot</code> partition, so that updates and changes to the bootloader are seamless and do not require
manual intervention.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I have done, in order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Install systemd-bootctl on the SD Card</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the kernel files from &#47;boot to the SD Card</p></li>
<li><p>Update <code>&#47;etc&#47;fstab</code> to mount the SD Card as <code>&#47;boot</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cool, now Linux actually starts to boot, loading kernel and bootloader from the SD Card (kinda
    slow, but better than nothing I guess). The keywords are <em>starts to boot</em> because it
never gets to the Display Manager, failing to mount some drive listed in <code>&#47;etc&#47;fstab</code>, and
throwing me in the initramfs recovery shell.
From here I can check which drives are giving problems. And guess what? the SD Card that cannot be found.</p>

<p>My only idea at this point is that eMMC device support is loaded as a kernel module, at least for how Mint&#8217;s
kernel is compiled. A quick check with <code>zcat &#47;proc&#47;config.gz</code> that I did later confirmed it.</p>

<p>So I edit <code>&#47;etc&#47;fstab</code> once and for all to ignore errors relative to <code>&#47;boot</code>. This means that
Mint will not mount the SD Card automatically at boot, but I will have to intervene to manually
on something like a kernel update, since systemd-bootctl requires <code>initramfs-linux and vmlinuz</code> to
be on the same partition, which needs to be mounted to <code>&#47;boot</code>.</p>

<p>Speaking of kernel updates, <code>update-initramfs</code> is broken! And this took me a while to figure out.
<code>update-initramfs</code> does exactly what the name says. In Mint, kernel files are stored as
<code>initrd._version_</code> and <code>vmlinuz._version_</code> files. Upon an update, <code>update-initramfs</code> puts
the new kernel in <code>&#47;boot</code>, recompiles what is needed and makes sure to keep at least one older version, together with
the current one, in that folder. <code>update-initramfs</code> then symlinks the newest
files to <code>initrd</code> and <code>vmlinuz</code> respectevely to avoid messing with grub.cfg everytime
there is an update.</p>

<p>Well, I formatted my sdcard as FAT32, which does not support symlinks! So I disabled them
by placing this line in <code>&#47;etc&#47;kernel-img.conf</code></p>

<pre><code>do_symlinks = no
</code></pre>

<p>This also means that now I have to intervene on every kernel update to make sure systemd-bootctl
is using the right files. Totally not seamless, but at least it works, am I right? No? ( :&#47;
    ).</p>

<p>Needless to say, I ended up buying the 2.5&#8217; sata adapter to install a SSD like a normal human
being. Though I will still try to install Win10 on the Sata SSD and Linux on the NVME one and
have a solid dual boot. Yet this little adventure made for a fun night of debugging and
tinkering, which always makes me happy.</p>
